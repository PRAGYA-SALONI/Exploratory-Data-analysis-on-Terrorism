# Exploratory-Data-analysis-on-Terrorism
Conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis on the Global terrorism Database to identify hot zones of terrorosm and their underlying causes.
Utilized Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess the data ensuring its quality and accuracy.
Employed visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various count plots to visualize the data and uncover patterns and treands, such as the frequency of different types of attacks and their geographic distribution.
Analyzed the data to draw insights as a defence analyst, such as identifying the countries and regions that suffered the highest and lowest number of attacks the types of attacks that were most prevalent in each area and suggested potential measures to reduces terrorism.
